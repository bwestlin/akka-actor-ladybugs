# Akka Actor Ladybugs #

Once when studying at [KTH](http://www.kth.se/) we had a programming assignment consisting of building an
application where [Ladybugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinellidae) would wander around on the screen
living their life.

The hard part of that assignment was that each ladybug must be represented by its own
[thread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_\(computing\)) which should handle all operations concerning the
ladybug that it represented, including drawing to the screen.
This exercise was mainly about learning to program correctly in the realms of multi-threading and the exercise
was set to be done in C++ targeting the Win32 API.

*Here follows a video of that application running:*

I remember spending quite a lot of time on this assignment, not only on the programming part but also on the
graphics side where I put some extra effort modelling and animating the ladybugs in 3D-studio.
The year must have been 1999.

Ever since taking the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) course
[Principles of Reactive Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) I've had the idea to reimplement
this old school assignment using [Akka](http://akka.io/) where each ladybug would be represented by an
[Actor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).

My idea for the end result is be to display the ladybugs wandering around in a web-browser updating the current
state in real-time through a [websocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

This project is currently a work in progress. It's not feature complete compared to the original, but will be
eventually.
 
It can be seen live right now by browsing to: [http://ladybugs.herokuapp.com/](http://ladybugs.herokuapp.com/)  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## Running ##
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The easiest way to run this application is with the following command in the base directory:                                                                                                                                    
```
./activator run
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
After this it can be accessed from a web browser at **http://localhost:8080/**.

To run in development mode use:
```
./activator ~re-start
```
This will run it in such a way that it will recompile and restart upon changes thanks to
